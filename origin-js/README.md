# origin-js

origin-js is a library of javascript code and Ethereum smart contracts which allow anyone to create decentralized marketplaces, including for fractional usage. It is an open source project created by [Origin Protocol](https://www.originprotocol.com/).

⚠️ This is an alpha version which is not suitable for production environments.

## Documentation

[origin-js documentation](http://docs.originprotocol.com/)

## Demo

Our DApp is currently running on the Ethereum mainnet and showcases what can be achieved with origin-js.

- [Overview and step-by-step instructions](https://medium.com/originprotocol/draft-origin-launches-beta-on-mainnet-draft-e3b70161ae86)
- [Live Demo](http://dapp.originprotocol.com)
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-dapp#origin-demo-dapp)

## Using origin-js in your project

### As a node package

```
npm install origin --save
```
or
```
yarn add origin
```

### Plain javascript

A browser-compatible plain javascript file `origin.js` is available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/releases). A hosted version can be directly included in your html as:
```html
<script src="https://code.originprotocol.com/origin-js/origin-v0.7.1.js"></script>
```

`npm build` will generate this file and save it to `dist/origin.js`.

## Tests

### Command Line (All Tests)

Our full test suite can be run with:

```
npm run test
```

 Note: you should *not* have the server running at this time, as these tests start their own local blockchain instance.

To run tests and automatically re-run when files change:
```
npm run test:jsw
```

## Troubleshooting

### Python 3

If you have Python 3 installed, you may see this error when installing dependencies:

```
gyp ERR! stack Error: Python executable "/Users/aiham/.pyenv/shims/python" is v3.6.4, which is not supported by gyp.
```

Resolve this by configuring npm to use Python 2 (where python2.7 is a binary accessible from your $PATH):

```
npm config set python python2.7
```
